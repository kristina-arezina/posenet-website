# PoseNet Demo / Resources Website
Hello ðŸ‘‹

I made this simple website that has a live demo of pose estimation! 
I used PoseNet to make the pose estimation work and have linked the resources I used in the website ðŸ™‚

To learn about Pose Estimation with PoseNet I would recommend checking out the Tutorial Daniel Shiffman From The Coding Train made:

Then to get a better understanding of how PoseNet works I would recommend to check out their Github page:
